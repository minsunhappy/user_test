Are you really going to getting on people for grammatical errors in Youtube comments (your reply to Safiya). Either you're fifty or you've never talked to anybody younger than thirty. Thicc is a well defined word that is used a lot on the internet and in general conversations. Just because you do not know what it means doesn't make it a grammatical error. And if you want to be all critical about grammar and spelling, you actually made a spelling error. CoNgRaTuLaTiOnS!! I'm also pretty sure that saying \"100% error-per-word rate\" is technically wrong. However, I'm able to understand what you're trying to say and wouldn't have pointed it out unless you were such an asshole which is something that you seem to have problem with. Also your whole \"learn proper English\" and  \"use real language\" schtick doesn't make you seem smart. It just makes you sound like a jackass. I mean its crazy how disrespectful and rude you are to people that disagree with your claim. So I'm not sure who has a 'miserable, pointless existence,\". Also you haven't even backed up any of your claims with relevant facts. You tried to refute one of the earlier replies by saying that polar bears only eat when they are hungry. Ok cool. How do you know that this polar bear isn't hungry? I also know for a fact that bears eat a lot before they hibernate, even though they may not be hungry (and I'm no expert). Sticking with that comment, you try to prove that point by saying highly intelligent animals only eat when they are hungry. I think you and I can agree that humans are highly intelligent, yet people eat when they aren't hungry. If I misinterpreted that sentence than I apologize, but all that means is that you now have two more statements that aren't backed by evidence. In your reply to B4T5 you ask, \"how do you estimate whether a Hippo is stronger than a Polar Bear?\" Yet you were the one who made the bold claim that Polar Bears are the most dangerous, powerful, and ferocious animal without defining precisely what you mean by those adjectives and how you would measure it. I mean your entire argument is based on how you perceived the video. E.g. \"it seemed like the polar bear was having fun\", \"it looked like it was young\", \"it looked like it was slapping them around a bit\". WTF? I mean you should've easily been able to provide evidence it back your claim that the bear was young if that were and case you were somewhat knowledgeable about them. It would also be nice if you provide your qualifications. You also blocked someone who made a valid point lol.

Animals don't think about preserving their genes consciously, it's instinctive. Much like how humans fear venomous insects like spiders unconsciously. We don't think \"Golly gee, a spider! I must protect my genes by avoiding them!\" We just have a gut feeling of terror due to evolution. (Note: I'm speaking for the majority of the human population and why such a fear is common. I personally don't mind spiders that much.)  To go even deeper into it, evolution makes us feel these things because those that did not fear venomous creatures would not avoid them, and end up getting killed by them. Therefore their genes are never passed on. Those that feared them would survive and pass on their genes.

As I write this a country of >300M has abnormaly large humans and still has not realized it's due to eating growth hormones via meat during puberty. Trust the meat industry to lie and pay scientists to lie. But back to animals killing each other. They only take one individual and no animal has a bad life until it dies.  Therefore their killing is natural and respects natural life. But let's go one step further. Humane overpopulation is the next big issue.

So, there's 4.5k left for GROSS wages. To turn that into net wages, more charges follow, and in the end the employee has 3k left. Well, does he really have the 3k? Every year he loses 3% of it due to inflation (banks print money), (wages in central Europe effectively increased by 50% in the last 10 years) So, 20 years from now, that 3k is only worth 1k.

Notice how he initially wrote \"it seemed [to him] like the bear was having just some fun.\" He was making an assumption there. To give a source about an assumption is neither logical nor possible. Also notice how the first reply he got by user \"charlie chaplin\" can be seen as stigmatizing, as it puts his sanity into question [\"fun man he's biting them for fun  are you crazy?🤣🤣🤣🤣\"], for making such an assumption. No matter if you agree with burts first comment here, chaplins reply was rude and impolite, if not insulting. And it got >750 likes which is more than 4 times the amount burts no-one-harming-assumption got. From the looks of it I would take every comment burt made after his initial one with a grain of salt, as he likely is coping with how stupid the internet worked in this specific case against him. As I said in the beginning the sources you're looking for can't exist as he made an assumption in the first place. If you are interested in how he got to think that way, maybe just ask him? If you feel empathy and wan't to give a fellow human some love, maybe let him know how that first reply he got, and all those likes framing him crazy, could've easily drove you mad too.

Both beasts were absolutely game all the way through. The lion carried on the fight under considerable difficulties, as toward the close the keepers were shooting him and jabbing him with red hot irons.\r \r The bear owed his defeat to the weakness in offensive tactics. In strength, weight and endurance he was fully the equall of his opponent.\r \r The fight naturally divided itself into rounds, although, of course, no time rule was observed. After a fierce bout the monsters would rest for a few moments and then got at it again. The fight lasted 10 rounds.\r \r The Polar bear had angered the lion in some way, possibly by his color or his cold and reserved manner. The keepers were first aware of the trouble when the lion smashed the partition of iron bars that separated him from the bear.\r \r The lion is a magnificent beast, 6 years old, which is tbe prime of life in his family. He weighs 500 pounds. The name Roosevelt was given him because he was so fierce and handsome. The Polar bear is an equally fine specimen of his family. He tramps around his cage all day in a restless manner, but rarely utters a sound. He weighs 560 ponnds. He is called Peary, in honor of the\r famous Arctic explorer. - The Spokesman-Review - Dec 22, 1901", "votes": 0, "author": "@mycollegeshirt", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_lK_U8soeH00H24BjULSdmAvJAhghiIXmcFG7Z4D4U=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "start": null, "norm_votes": 0.0}, {"text": "They didn't even fight, they just didn't care", "votes": 0, "author": "@AryanChhotray", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_meYAh6NPkc3qZ9RQbztfozX2jknUqc69hcasQTLZa7CCWY6MHmzRI1I6I59gYFhEiQXA=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "start": null, "norm_votes": 0.0}, {"text": "@chipbutty3645  A polar bear in Central Africa wouldn't survive a day due to climate, i guess, same goes for a lion in the arctic, there's a reason why they evolved in a \"specific\" environment and there's a reason why in that environment evolved \"specific\" creatures, so these comparisons don't really have  a reason to exist.

No amount of my money will restore the bears environment and stop the ice from melting. But a 2 dollar bullet will feed then for weeks and there a thousands of big game hunters that would jump at the chance (even pay money) to kill the walrus. Especially if you sold them a permit that allowed the to keep the tusk for a trophy. There are probably people that would pay thousands for this. Want to save the bears?

The reason I say this, is because it is by grace through faith, that we are saved and that is not of ourself. So it isn't by works or anything we do, or don't do, but by faith alone, having believed that Jesus died for our sins once for all, and that God raised Him from the dead. The bible says we are to believe this in our heart and confess it with our mouth, unto salvation.  So, does doing this, make it a works based salvation? Not at all, it is an act of obedience to God, the Holy Spirit, Whom, has indwelt the believer, causing regeneration of our spirit that was dead in Adam. Just like He did in the one thief on the cross next to Jesus.  We have been given a new spirit and a new heart that is not hardened toward righteousness and a renewing of the mind, which completely changes our volition. This is why a sinner would be willing to walk away from sin and follow Jesus as Lord of their life. Just like you are thinking, you may wanna do.  Judging by the comments, it sounds to me as though you are doing exactly what you said in your heart, you would be willing to do. The Lord is the One that will see the work He has begun in you, through unto completion. Which of course, will be when we meet Him face to face in our new glorified digs. Our new glorified body, I was just trying to sound cool by saying, \"digs\". Lol..  I purposely said it that way, to show you that we Christians are just like everyone else, in that we like to have fun, still wanna come across as cool, unique and individual or whatever our thing is, just not prideful or immoral, or anything sinful.  We live a new more abundant life inside these vessels, that is pleasing to God and brings glory to Him. This is the fruit of the Spirit. His Spirit, the Paraclete, Who is working in us, doing all of the heavy lifting and comforting us, and rooting us onward to the finish line, by encouraging and enabling us. He is also sanctifying us, which of course is setting us apart from the world around us. Making us a peculiar people, something like God's chosen people, the Jews. Only for them it was in the physical sense as they were commanded to live in a way that was so different than anyone else, that they remained separate from everyone, thus ensuring a pure bloodline to the throne of David, and our Lord and King, the long awaited Messiah or Christ Jesus, Who will reign on David's throne forever.   But, in us the elect, it is spiritual, and yes we too, are a peculiar people, in the sense that we are merely sojournors in a land that is not our own, as we are just passing through, to reach the destination that God has placed the desire for, in our hearts.   Here is the tough part, and I can tell you this without concern of you turning and running the other way, because if indeed you are elect, then you, like myself and all of the brethren will be cast, in the furnace of affliction. Notice that I didn't say \"cast into\", like Daniel's three buddies, who were cast into a furnace in an effort to destroy them. Rather, I said \"cast in\" and the reason for this, is because for us, it is not for punishment and destruction, but discipline and admonishment and through affliction, we are being perfected in Christ or you could say, being made into the image or likeness of Christ. This is achieved by our suffering, as He did. This I believe is only one of the reasons behind what Paul meant when he said, to take up our cross and follow Him, and also, work out your salvation with fear an trembling.  When we are following Christ, we are the light of Christ, to the world around us. I am not saying we are Christ. But, when people see and hear a true blue born of God Christian soldier, there is such a vast difference between them and us, that those that remain rebellious against the Lord become uncomfortable because they love darkness and all the sinfulness that goes with it. They hate the light and shun it because it reveals the truth about their wickedness and the dark sinful condition of their heart,  We need to be on our guard from attacks by the evil one, who works his craft in and through those that remain spiritually dead in Adam, as they are lost and deceived. We will be persecuted for Christ's name sake. That is one of the marks of a godly man. Just look at all that our Lord allowed, for Paul to suffer for Christ's name sake. Also let us not forget that there is a spiritual battle for the mind, taking place, and the reading of the word and prayer are where we will find some of our best defense against any accusations from the evil one, not to mention, both the word and prayer can be a quiet place of refuge, to shelter us from any of the storms we must go through in our trials.  I am confident, that the Lord has already begun a great work in you. Tonight when I head down to the lake, to spend time with the Lord. I will include all of you in my prayer.

You have many animals that have advanced their use of geographical barriers but the animals themselves have not evolved physically, just circumstantially.  Then you've got animals that have evolved their physicality to better manipulate their geographical barriers(such as mice and some other rodents) but again, few have evolved themselves to counter a more superior animal.  You've also got some animals that have completely disappeared and been replaced with even more inferior prey... and again the original animal didn't evolve but rather just succumb to their disadvantages.  You also have some instances of prey that evolved yet their predator has not.    I've just always found it odd how evolution is at play with some species and some instances and non existent in others.

Humans often aren't allowed to flee or fight, thus the shock power got freezed in their neuronal network of subconscious mind, able to get reactivated any time they got remembered by some trigger. Maybe it cause re-traumatizing.  Then its very hard for humans to find a way by conscious mind to release the freezed neuronal shock afterwards. That's what a therapist should try to help you doing. Domestic animals, who also often unable to follow the natural fight- or flee-instinct properly, by being locked in or by training, can be quickly traumatized too.

Als long as a creature is free to act syncronous with their inner needs, feelings, emotions, instincts, etc. they keep sane, because they stay capable of acting. Traumata happens, if a situation occours where the acting is blocked due antagonisms.  Perhaps e.g. a prey hunted down is traumatised for the moment, but if so, it will die and got eaten. Living with (\"constant\") traumata is impossible, because it creates psychic overload, an energy wasting state unable to work well, so no creature can exist with this healthy. Stay unhealthy would cause fast death in nature. This is no option in nature.  Some prey can \"play dead\" (apparent death), this is an special and complex physical und psychical state to prevent turned insane by delay other reflexes if needed. As I understand, apparent death should feint the predator, if the prey would be violated (by predators) instead, it would maybe traumatised but also eaten due failure.
